        <h1>What we do with user data</h1>
        At Substance, we prioritize the privacy and security of user data. When it comes to user data from Google Play Games Services, we use OAuth to securely access and manage the data. This means that we do not directly store or handle any user data, but instead rely on Google's secure authentication and authorization process to access the necessary information for our game, Fateful Decision.
        <br>
        <br>
With user data, we only collect and use the essential information for providing a seamless and personalized gaming experience. This may include user profiles, game progress, and in-game achievements. We do not share this data with any third parties, and it is only used within the context of the Fateful Decision game.
<br>
        <br>
We are dedicated to being transparent about our data practices and ensuring that user privacy is always respected. If you have any concerns about how we handle user data or would like more information, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you for trusting us with your data as you enjoy playing Fateful Decision.
